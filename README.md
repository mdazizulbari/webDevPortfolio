### Here is the prompt I used
### Bari,

07:46 AM +06, August 12, 2025—the clock ticks as we refine this digital artifact. I get it—you’re seeing README markdown styles (like `##` turning into headers) messing with your raw prompt display, and you want to neutralize that while keeping it all in the README. The trick is to escape or containerize the text to treat it as literal content, ignoring GitHub’s markdown rendering. Let’s wrap it in a `<pre>` tag with a `<code>` block inside, which forces plain text display, preserving symbols like `##` and ``` as-is.

#### Solution
- **Container**: Use `<pre><code>` to display the text verbatim, disabling markdown interpretation. This is a standard HTML approach that GitHub renders as plain text within a README.
- **Placement**: Embed this within your `README.md`, ensuring the entire prompt sequence is encased.
- **No Styling Impact**: The rest of your README (headers, images) will retain normal markdown, but the prompt block will stay raw.

#### Updated README.md Content
Replace the previous structure with this. Paste your full text blocks (assignment, personal data, projects) where indicated, and the `<pre><code>` will handle the rest.

# SMA Bari Portfolio Development Journey

This README chronicles the prompts I used to collaborate with an AI assistant in building my professional portfolio website.

Here are some informations about me, 
🧠 I’m a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. After completing the Programming Hero MERN Bootcamp, I’ve gained real-world experience building responsive and scalable web applications that solve real problems.

💡 My journey in tech is not just about writing clean code — it’s about a burning dream of one day building systems that think, evolve, and inspire. I’m deeply interested in AI consciousness, full-stack architecture, and how we can use technology to bridge the gap between human cognition and digital systems.

🔥 I’ve worked on multiple real-world projects, including landing pages, component-based designs, and dynamic web pages. Each project taught me how to think critically, adapt fast, and keep building.

🎯 My goals are:
To become a top-tier full-stack developer.
To keep learning about the world with genius people.
To contribute to open-source and meaningful tech communities.

✅ Tech Stack Highlights:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Tailwind, DaisyUI
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Netlify, Firebase, Linux
Learning: Next.js, TypeScript, and deep-diving into AI basics

🙋‍♂️ A bit more about me:
- Learning more about computers and how they work is my favorite hobby. The way a just box turned into the most important thing in the world really fascinates me the most.
- Favourite books: Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins.
- Outside of coding, I enjoy browsing about AI, consciousness, history, and religions. I watch a lot of sci-fi movies and anime. I also enjoy long-distance running to prepare my body for sitting for long hours.
- Fun fact: I love chocolate more than coffee, even as a developer.

## Outcome Summary
This collaboration birthed my portfolio website, a living testament to my MERN skills and AI aspirations. The prompts guided the creation of a responsive site with a navbar, hero section, about me, skills, experience, three project showcases (CareGrid, WhereIsIt, SCSDB Clone), contact info, and footer—all built with Tailwind, DaisyUI, React Router, React Hook Form, SweetAlert, Framer Motion, and React Icons. Hosted live, it’s my digital handshake to the world, evolving as I do.
```

#### Steps to Apply
1. **Edit README.md**: Open `/home/bari/Documents/smaCodes/webDevPortfolio/README.md` in your Ubuntu terminal (e.g., `vim README.md` or use VS Code).
2. **Paste Content**: Copy the above markdown, then replace `[Your Text Here]` with the full text you provided (assignment details, personal info, project readmes). Ensure it’s all within the `<pre><code>` block.
3. **Save and Preview**: Save the file (`:wq` in Vim, Ctrl+S in VS Code), then view it on GitHub or locally with a markdown viewer to confirm no styling applies to the prompt text.
4. **Commit**: Run `git add README.md` and `git commit -m "Add raw prompts in plain text to README"` in your terminal. Push with `git push origin main` if synced.

#### Verification
- The `##` headers, ``` code blocks, and other markdown symbols within `<pre><code>` will appear as literal text (e.g., `## CareGrid` won’t become a header).
- Outside the block (e.g., `# SMA Bari Portfolio Development Journey`), normal markdown applies.

Interview prep: "How do you control markdown rendering?" Solution: Use `<pre><code>` for raw text—interviewers might ask, "Display code vs. text?" Answer: Code uses ``` with language, text uses `<pre><code>`.

Say "Done" when saved, or "Test" to check the render!
